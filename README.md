eAR and ePS screenshots

These are screenshots from the Apple Volume Purchase Program apps, eAR (electronic Anesthesia Record) and ePS (electronic Perioperative System) that I built as Director of Technology at iStream Technologies. eAR looks embarassingly like a 2005 PC app to me today, I much prefer the master-detail approach (with skinny lhs drawer) from the ePS as a method for managing complex hierarchies of information, much like the Apple Settings app.
